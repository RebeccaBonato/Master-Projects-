# Digital Thermomether 

The goal of the project is to make a device that can measure temperature using an LM35 digital sensor and display it to the user in degrees Centigrade or Fahrenheit. Specifically, the LM35 sensor is a digital sensor that outputs a current value proportional to the temperature sensed. The Arduino, programmed in assembly, takes the current value as input and through a proper look up table converts it into the corresponding temperature value. The user, by pressing a button, can change the display settings from centigrade to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Finally, the result is shown through three displays if the temperature is in the range of 30 °C to 45 °C. If the measured temperature is outside the defined range, the displays will turn off. 


Personally, it was one of the projects I most enjoyed. The low-level programming in assembly allowed me to understand the operation of all the blocks of a microcontroller. In addition, it made me familiar with basic analog and digital electronics, the conversion from analog to digital, the combination of logic gates, and flow charts.

The project was carried out at the Turin Polytechnic with a colleague, William Bennardo.  At this [link](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Digital%20Thermometer/Thermometer%20-%20Final%20Report%20and%20Assembly%20Code.pdf) you can find the final report in which the project is explained in detail and the code.
