# Heart Hackathon 

In November 2022, I decided to join a student team to participate in a competition called [Heart Hackathon](https://www.hearthackathon.com/). 
This was a year-long competition involving students and universities from all over the world with a very ambitious goal: building a prototype of a total artificial heart. 

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The gold standard treatment is heart transplants; however, there are long waiting lists and strict requirements to be on the list. That's where the total artificial heart, which is replacing completely the human heart with an artificial one, comes into play. 

I loved the learning process that accompanied us throughout this project. 
Initially, we read about commercial artificial hearts, their problems, the many unsolved challenges, the implantation procedures via surgery,the different modes of operation. Then we defined the requirements, that is, the challenges we wanted to focus on. 
At this point, the device design process began: brainstorming, sketches, similarities with other devices,... 

But the biggest step was taken when it was time to move from theory to practice. Before that, we had never had to build an electrical-mechanical device from scratch. 
The selection of materials to work with, their fabrication process (i.e. how to make them the desired shape and size), the selection of the motor and electronics, gave us an idea of the problems and the infinite unknowns to consider. I think this is what I take home most from this experience: the continuous process of trying and failing that ultimately leads to learning so much.

Finally, when the device was functioning. We had the honor of testing it in the hybrid mockloop at the KTH, Royal Institute of technology. The hybrid mockloop is an in vitro model of the cardiovascular system that can simulate different physiological and pathological condition. In this way, we were able to verify the functioning of the artificial heart following the application of different pressures as input and output.

I had the opportunity to personally work in a two-month internship during summer 2023 on the optimisation of the model to be 3D printed, the programming of the motor using a driver and an arduino in different modes, testing and organizing data.

And finally a big surprise: our abstract was accepted at the conference 49th ESAO & IFAO CONGRESS - BERGAMO, ITALY. There, we had the opportunity to present our [Poster](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Heart%20Hackathon/TAH%20Poster.pdf) and to hear about the state-of-the-art research in the field of artificial organs.
