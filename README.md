# Master-Projects-
This archive contains some projects realised during my Master's degree in biomedical engineering. Some projects are part of university courses, while others were realized as part of extra-university activities or were realised out of my own enthusiasm. 

These two years of master classes have been years full of adventures and experiences, in which I personally feel I have learnt a lot. I spent time at the polytechnic in Turin (Italy), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) and was exposed to completely different teaching approaches. So why not organise the projects I learnt the most from, the most challenging and interesting in one repository?
