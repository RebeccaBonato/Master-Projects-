# Master-Projects-
This repository contains some projects realised during my Master's degree in biomedical engineering. Some projects are part of university courses, while others were realized as part of extra-university activities or out of my own enthusiasm. 

These two years of master classes have been years full of adventures and experiences, in which I personally feel I have learnt a lot. I spent time at the Politecnico di Torino (Italy), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) and was exposed to completely different teaching approaches. So why not organise the projects I learnt the most from, the most challenging and interesting, in one repository? 

The master's specialisation that I decided to undertake concerns 'biomedical instrumentation', which I had the opportunity to study in depth from several perspectives:

1. The development process of **programmable biomedical devices** in their hardware and software parts. 
   * Through the use of a digital temperature sensor, displays and arduino, a [Digital Thermometer](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Digital%20Thermometer/DigitalThermometer.md) was assembled and programmed.
   * Development of an artificial heart prototype for a year-long global student competition titled [Heart Hackathon](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Heart%20Hackathon/Heart%20Hackathon.md)

2. The application of **machine learning and deep learning algorithms** in the biomedical field. Indeed, they are becoming increasingly popular not only for diagnostic support but also for the development of applications for wellness and fitness or rehabilitation purposes.
   * Deep Learning in Medical Images: challenge [ISLES2022](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/ISLES22/README.md)
   * ECG signal classification
   * Human Pose estimation for fitness application: [fitness activity tracking](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Fitness%20Activity%20Tracking/Fitness%20Activity%20Tracking.md)
     
3. Analysis of **medical images** with a particular focus on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and Computerized tomography (CT).
   * [MRI image reconstruction from radial sampling](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/Radial%20sampling%20in%20MRI/README.md)
   * [Atlas based segmentation and analysis of pelvic bone in CT images](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/tree/main/Segmentation%20Atlas)
