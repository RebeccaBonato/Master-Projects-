# ECG time series classification

The objective of this project is to classify 12-lead ECG signals using a machine or deep learning algorithm.

The classification is multi-class (5 classes present) and multi-label (each ECG can be assigned more than one class). Each ECG can be classified as normal ECG, myocardial infarction, ST/T change, conduction disturbance and/or hypertrophy. 

The algorithm provides a rudimentary classification, which would certainly be improved by adding preprocessing to the signals (work in progress!). 

More information can be found in the [report](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/ECG/BonatoRebecca_ECG_Classification_Report.pdf) while the code is available at this [link](https://github.com/RebeccaBonato/Master-Projects-/blob/main/ECG/Assignment%203%20-ECG.ipynb)
