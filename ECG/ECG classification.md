# ECG time series classification

The objective of this project is to classify 12-lead ECG signals using a machine or deep learning algorithm. 
This is not an easy problem as the classification is multi-class (5 classes present) and multi-label (each ECG can be assigned more than one class) 

Each ECG can be classified as normal ECG, myocardial infarction, ST/T change, conduction disturbance and/or hypertrophy. 

The algorithm provides a rudimentary classification, which would certainly be improved by adding preprocessing to the signals (work in progress!). 

More information can be found in the report while the code is available at this link
