# Digital Thermomether 

The goal of the project is to make a device that can measure temperature using an LM35 digital sensor and display it to the user in degrees centigrade or Fahrenheit. Specifically, the LM35 sensor is a digital sensor that, depending on the sensed temperature, outputs a current value proportional to it. The Arduino, programmed in assembly, takes the current value as input and through a proper look up table converts it into the corresponding temperature value. The user, by pressing a button, can change the display settings from centigrade to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Finally, the result is shown through three displays if the temperature is in the range of 30 °C to 45 °C. If the measured temperature is outside the defined range, the displays will turn off. 


Personally, it was one of the projects I most enjoyed. The low-level programming in assembly allowed me to understand the operation of all the blocks of a microcontroller. In addition, it made me familiar with basic analog and digital electronics, the conversion from analog to digital, the combination of logic gates, and flow charts.
